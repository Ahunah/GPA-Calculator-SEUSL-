✅ This README mirrors the style of your **Band Beat App** README, just tailored for the GPA calculator.

If you want, I can **also generate a ready-to-use version with all your app screenshots URLs** already embedded so you only need to push the `assets/screenshots` folder.

Do you want me to do that next?
